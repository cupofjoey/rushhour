# rushhour

* Rush Hour is an MVC project brought to Paul Chin Jr and myself by Rollinsio. It is an attempt to build a board for a puzzle game using JSON and other OOP methods. It will be a professional development project, with traditional pushes to Github and pull requests by our "handlers" to see what progress we have made with the code.
